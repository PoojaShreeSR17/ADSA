Applying the algorithm to the given sequence of matrices:
In the example above, we have a sequence of matrices with dimensions [10, 30, 5, 60].

Calculating the minimum number of scalar multiplications:
The minimum number of scalar multiplications required for the optimal parenthesization is obtained from m[1][n], where n is the number of matrices.

Explaining the dynamic programming approach:
m[i][j] represents the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to compute the product of matrices from Ai to Aj. We start with chain_length = 2 and gradually build up the chain.
s[i][j] stores the index k at which the optimal split is made when multiplying matrices from Ai to Aj.
Analyzing time and space complexity:
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^3), where n is the number of matrices. This is because we have a triple nested loop.
In practice, this algorithm is efficient and performs well for moderately large instances.
Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(n^2) due to the matrices m and s.
Efficiency in Solving Large Instances:

This dynamic programming approach is efficient for solving large instances of the problem, as long as the number of matrices is not extremely large. The time complexity of O(n^3) allows it to handle reasonably sized inputs.
Overall, this algorithm provides an efficient solution to the matrix chain multiplication problem and is widely used in practice for optimizing matrix multiplications in computer graphics, numerical simulations, and other fields.
