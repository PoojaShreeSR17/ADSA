Applying the algorithm to find all possible solutions:
You can call the solve_n_queens(n) function with the desired value of N to find all possible solutions for the N-Queens problem.

Presenting solutions as chessboard representations:
The print_solutions(solutions) function prints the solutions with 'Q' for queens and '.' for empty squares.

Explaining the backtracking approach:
The algorithm uses backtracking to explore all possible queen placements while ensuring that no two queens threaten each other.
It starts with an empty chessboard and recursively tries to place queens row by row.
The is_safe() function checks if it's safe to place a queen in a specific row and column by examining rows, columns, and diagonals.
If a valid placement is found, it moves on to the next row, and when all queens are placed successfully, a solution is added to the list of solutions.
Analyzing the time complexity:
The time complexity of this backtracking algorithm for the N-Queens problem is typically exponential, specifically O(N!). This is because there are N choices for the first queen, (N-1) choices for the second queen, (N-2) choices for the third queen, and so on. In the worst case, the number of recursive calls and the number of possibilities to explore grows factorially with N.

Efficiency for larger values of N:

This algorithm becomes impractical for large values of N, as the number of possibilities grows rapidly.
Various optimizations and heuristics can be applied to improve efficiency, but for very large N, more advanced algorithms may be required.
For smaller N, this algorithm works reasonably well and provides all unique solutions to the N-Queens problem.
