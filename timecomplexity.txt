Analyzing the time complexity and stability of Bubble Sort:
Time Complexity: Bubble Sort has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) because it involves nested loops. In the best case (when the array is already sorted), it has a time complexity of O(n) due to the optimized flag.

Stability: Bubble Sort is a stable sorting algorithm. It does not change the relative order of equal elements.

Performance on different inputs:

Best Case: O(n) - When the array is already sorted.
Worst Case: O(n^2) - When the array is reverse sorted.
Average Case: O(n^2) - For random data.
